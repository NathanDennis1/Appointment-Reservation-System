# SQL-and-Python-Database-Project-Assignment

# Python and SQL Database project. Created a vaccine scheduler which was connected to a Microsoft Azure Database.
# Caregivers and Patients create accounts, where they both have different functions.
# Caregivers are able to upload their availability, show their appointments, and revise vaccine counts.
# Patients can reserve or cancel appointments, search the caregivers schedule and show their appointments.
# All reservations made by patients, all availabilites made by caregivers, and all vaccines and doses are in the Azure database.
